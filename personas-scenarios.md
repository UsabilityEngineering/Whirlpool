# Personas

## Jack

Jack is a new college student who has never lived away from home. His mom used to do all his laundry, so he does not really know what he is doing and feels overwhelmed at the thought of cleaning all his clothes.

## Gina

Gina is a mom who has a low income. While her husband goes to work during the day, she is left to watch their three young children and make sure the house is tidy. Every other day, she goes to the laundromat to do her entire family's laundry.

## Robert

Robert is an old man who lives next door to the laundromat. Robert's washer/drier is broken, so he has been coming once a week to wash his things. He is always worried someone will take his clothes so he sits and watches his laundry as it washes and dries.

# Scenarios

## (A) Jacks First Laundry Day

Jack just finished his first week of college and realized all of his clothes are dirty. Heâ€™s never done his own laundry before so he calls his mom, who assures him it's very easy and to go to the local laundromat to wash his clothes. She describes to him what he needs to do, so he goes and picks up some laundry detergent and brings all his dirty clothes to the laundromat.

## (B) A Busy Day

Gina takes her three children and all of their dirty clothes to the laundromat. She has a hair appointment in a couple hours and knows that she needs to get all of her laundry done before her appointment. She's in a hurry, but her children seem to love the laundromat and do not want to leave. 

## (C) Worried Customer

Robert is a grumpy old man whose washer and dryer are broken. He is not used to coming to the laundromat and feels nervous about leaving his clothes in the washer/drier. He wants to sit and watch his clothes so no one takes them, but finds himself bored after a few minutes of watching the spin cycle. He is not sure how people do this every week.
