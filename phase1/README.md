# Whirlpool, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods
A) The requirements gathering techniques we used are naturalistic observation and a survey.

B) Naturalistic Observation - We used naturalistic observation so we could observe how people currently do their laundry to find ways that we can improve our product to match the inefficiencies with their current method. We thought this method would also provide us with good qualitative data that we can experience first hand rather than someone tellings us about their experience after the fact.

Survey - We chose to use a survey to supplement our observations so we could get input from our target audience of what they would want out of our product. This will give us input on what the users are thinking of their experience, which will go well with the data we have of watching them actually do it.

C) Sample Sizes:

Naturalistic Observation - N = 4

Survey - N = 18

## Findings

All of our users were students and low income families. We think these users accurately represent our user base because they represent a majority of people that use laundromats. We do recognize that this may be excluding some minority users that may use our product. We found that students were more likely to be receptive to improving their laundry experience with technology while families were more skeptical. Along with this, about half of all users use some sort of timer to keep track of when their laundry will be done. We also found that almost everybody does something else while waiting for their laundry, however some people are worried about theft so they wait and watch. 


## Conclusions
The way users interact with our product needs to be more streamlined. Our naturalistic observation study concluded that those in a hurry will often overlook or choose not to utilize our product to save time. We also found that our demographic is a bit wider than we anticipated, we included college students and low income families but also found that lots of people whose washers or driers are broken also frequent laundromats. This expands our demographics a bit and will allow us to seek a wider range of users in the future.


## Caveats
One caveat with our research is it is harder than anticipated to find enough users from our specific demographic. We have enough data to make observations, however some of it is from different demographics than we specified which could make the data more confusing. Although we found out we could expand our demographic, the users in the study did not necessarily satisfy our new found demographic. Along with that, lots of users said they would like improvements to their laundry machines, however did not give very much information on what they would like to be improved. We may want to consider adding another method (such as an interview) to get more detailed information from our users.
