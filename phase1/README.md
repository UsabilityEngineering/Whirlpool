# Whirlpool, Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

## Methods
A) The requirements gathering techniques we used are naturalistic observation and a survey.

B) Naturalistic Observation - We used naturalistic observation so we could observe how people currently do their laundry to find ways that we can improve our product to match the inefficiencies with their current method. We thought this method would also provide us with good qualitative data that we can experience first hand rather than someone tellings us about their experience after the fact.

Survey - We chose to use a survey to supplement our observations so we could get input from our target audience of what they would want out of our product. This will give us input on what the users are thinking of their experience, which will go well with the data we have of watching them actually do it.

C) Sample Sizes:

Naturalistic Observation - N = 4

Survey - N = 18

## Findings

All of our users were students and low income families. We think these users accurately represent our user base because they represent a majority of people that use laundromats. We do recognize that this may be excluding some minority users that may use our product. We found that students were more likely to be receptive to improving their laundry experience with technology while families were more skeptical. Along with this, about half of all users use some sort of timer to keep track of when their laundry will be done. We also found that almost everybody does something else while waiting for their laundry, however some people are worried about theft so they wait and watch.
