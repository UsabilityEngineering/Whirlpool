# Phase 2: Interaction Design

## Wireframes

This page contains screenshots of our wireframes. Each screen is represented here, however in the prototype some screens have duplicates to allow for a full interactive experience. We will describe why we chose to include each screen below.


The screen below is the starting page for our mobile app. The bottom navigation bar is how users will traverse the different sections of our app. The "Res" section is used to reserve machines at different laundromats, the "Home" section is where users can add machines and monitor their progress, and the "Stats" section is for users to see different statistics about their laundry habits.

If a user wants to reserve a machine, they can click on the "Res" section of the navigation bar. The first area of the "Res" section contains a search bar to look for launrdomats nearby, it also has a list of previously used laundromats to save the user some time if they go to the laundromat often. The stars next to the store names represent the users favorite stores. Users can toggle their favorites so they will always go to the top of the recents list, making it easy for them to select their most used laundromats.

Once the user selects a store, it opens up that specific stores information. Included in this information is a map of the store that will be color coded to show open and occupied machines. Below the map is a list of open machines, the user can select which machines they need in order to reserve them. Once they select their machines and click Done, the users machines will be reserved for one hour and they are redirected to the home page. The reservation page is shown below:

Users are not required to reserve any machines, however it will ensure that there will be machines ready for them when they get there. Whether the user reserved a machine or not, they will add the machine to their list in the same way. To add a machine, the user must simply press the plus button on the home page and take a picture of a QR code on the machine of their choice. The view of what this looks like is shown below.

We decided to do the adding of machines this way because it is simple and easy. From our user research data, we learned that some of our previous features were seen as too complicated and confusing to use. Our users said they would prefer starting their laundry to be quick and easy rather than compicated with extra features, so that is what we went with here. 

Once a machine's QR code has been scanned, it will be added to the home page to track its progress. This view is shown below:

If the users need more than one machine, they can simply press the plus button again and scan another machine. If this user required a drier as well, this is what it would look like after scanning the driers QR code:

Typically, the big red circle that says "Simulate Notification" will not be there. This is there in order to simulate what would happen when a machine finishes its cycle. Once a users machine is done, it will send them a notification that looks like this:
