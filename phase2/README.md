# Phase 2: Interaction Design

## Wireframes

This page contains screenshots of our wireframes. Each screen is represented here, however in the prototype some screens have duplicates to allow for a full interactive experience. We will describe why we chose to include each screen below.


The screen below is the starting page for our mobile app. The bottom navigation bar is how users will traverse the different sections of our app. The "Res" section is used to reserve machines at different laundromats, the "Home" section is where users can add machines that they are using and monitor their progress, and the "Stats" section is for users to see different statistics about their laundry habits.

To add a machine, the user must simply press the plus button and take a picture of a QR code on their machine. The view of what this looks like is shown below.

We decided to do the adding of machine this way because it is simple and easy. From our user research data, we learned that some of our previous features were seen as too complicated and confusing to use. Our users said they would prefer starting their laundry to be quick and easy rather than compicated with extra features, so that is what we went with here.
