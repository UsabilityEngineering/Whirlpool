# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**_Executive summary:_**
* Investigated user experiences with laundry services to identify user patterns and needs
     * Gathered information to make **knowledgeable** changes in order to make a more **user centered design**
     * Obtained input from users on **features** that could be **added or removed**
     
* **Online Survey** of college students and low income families (n=12) gave insight into the laundromat problem space
* **Naturalistic Observation** of college students and low income families (n=12) gave information about real life experiences and issues
* **A heavy majority (95%)** of users do something else while their laundry is in the wash.
* (85%) of those who responded to the survey are interested in making their **washer and dryers more sophisticated**.
* About **half (50%)** of users said they use some sort of timer to keep track of when their laundry will be done.
* **Students and low income families** who use laundromats are in favor of improving their laundry experience.
    * Students expressed **more enthusiasm** about adding more technology.
    * Low income parents are **more hesitant** about utilizing new convenient features. 
* Our planned features were seen as too **time consuming** based on reception from rushed users.
* Most survey participants **do not wash** their clothes at a laundromat, but provide responses based on personal experiences.
* **Designed personas and scenarios** to represent users with different concerns:
   * Jack - a young college student who does not know how to do laundry
   * Gina - a busy mom who stays at home watching her three children and keeping the house clean
   * Robert - an old man who is hesitant to leave his clothes washing at the laundromat
