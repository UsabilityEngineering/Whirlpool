## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

## Protocol

#### Overall Approach
For our protocol, we decided to go with a think-aloud summative approach. We chose to use a think-aloud approach because we believe that knowing what is going on in the user's head as they are doing it will provide us with the most useful data. Our app does not require precise timing or anything of that sort, so we decided that timing the user was unnecessary. Along with this, we chose to do a summative approach because we think that with the type of data we will be collecting, it will yield the best results. We will have lots of descriptive data by the end of the study, so a summative approach allows us to analyze all that data at the end and make any necessary changes to the design that the users disliked.
