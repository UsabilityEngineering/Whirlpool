## Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

## Protocol

#### Overall Approach
For our protocol, we decided to go with a think-aloud summative approach. We chose to use a think-aloud approach because we believe that knowing what is going on in the user's head as they are doing it will provide us with the most useful data. Our app does not require precise timing or anything of that sort, so we decided that timing the user was unnecessary. Along with this, we chose to do a summative approach because we think that with the type of data we will be collecting, it will yield the best results. We will have lots of descriptive data by the end of the study, so a summative approach allows us to analyze all that data at the end and make any necessary changes to the design that the users disliked.

#### Question and Task Explanation

Our protocol begins with a standard introduction. Following the user giving informed consent, we briefly explain to them what we will be doing in this study. Specifically, we mention that we are not testing the user's skills, but rather our software on the mobile app. We also make sure to tell them that the study will be video recorded and that we will delete the video at the end of the study. Along with all this, we make sure to mention to the participant that this is a "think-aloud" study, so they should let us know what they are thinking as they are doing it on the mobile app. Lastly, we ask the participant if they have any last questions before the study begins.

To start the usability test, we want to get some background on the participant. To do this, we ask the participant two questions. The first question is "Have you ever done your laundry at a laundromat?". We ask this because our mobile app has to do with laundromats so we would prefer our participants to be going their regularly. If they answer yes to this question, then they will get the follow up questions, "How often do you go to the laundromat?
How many loads do you typically do per trip to the laundromat?". These questions gives us insight into how much this participant relies on going to the laundromat. This is important because we want to be testing people who frequent laundromats.

After getting the background of the individual, we move onto the first task. For our first task, we ask the participant to walk through the process of reserving a machine. During this process, the moderator should be taking notes on the participants order of navigation throughout the process. They should also note anything important that the participant says while thinking aloud. After they have completed the task, we ask them the following questions: "How did the reservation process go? Was it easy to understand or did you run into any errors?". These questions help us to get an idea of wether or not our design for the reservation page makes sense and is easy to understand. If we get lots of negative feedback for this question, we will need to make some changes on our reservations page.

Our second task asks the participant to walk us through how they would start a washer and drier using the app. For this task we would provide them with QR codes to scan that represent the washer and drier. This task is a pretty quick one so we do not have any extra conditions for the moderator to pay attention to, we just want them to focus on how the participant is doing and what they are saying. Once the participant is done with the task, we ask them "How does this differ from your usual method? Did you find this method easier or more complex?". One aspect of our design we think users may find odd is this process of adding the machines, so we ask this question to check if participants like the way we do this or if they found it too complicated.

Our last task puts the participant in the shoes of someone who has already reserved and started their laundry. We tell them that they are out on the town waiting for their laundry to finish and they are about 10 minutes away from the laundromat. The participant is tasked with checking the app to see when their laundry will be done and choosing a time to leave so they will get there close to when their laundry is finished. During this task, we have the moderator take note of where the participant goes to find their laundry progress. We also have them note as a yes/no question if the participant made it to the laundromat within 2 minutes of their machines stopping time. We take note on both of these to see if it is easy enough to find the laundry progress on our app. Once the participant is done, we ask them "Did you find that the progress charts helped you to get back to the laundry in time? Why?". We ask this question because we want to ensure that the progress charts are helping the users and are not just there for show. We also have a notification area where users can check their time left, so we would like to know which page users typically are using to find that information.
